# Climate Action

Climate Action is a form of [deliberate existence](https://advancedresearch.github.io/blog/2022-03-10-deliberate-existence) to address [Climate Change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change).

### Should I do something?

Before you decide anything, you should collect and organize information that might be helpful for you to make a decision.

Humans often have a big Ego, which is formed by genes and culture.
In reality, most of the stuff going on in the world is not about us, still our lives are influenced by it.
This means that in order to know whether one can do something useful or not,
one has to reach into the "unknown" that goes past direct relevance for your own life in the moment.
If you can extend yourself in this way and think about the world this way, then it is possible for you to reason about Climate Action.
Otherwise, your best course of action is to rely on the direct advice by climate scientists.

Climate Action is best considered as a kind of outside-the-box way of thinking,
because our biases are not usually the best tool to support action.

### What is the worst possible thing that can happen?

To reason about Climate Action, one must understand the risks.
The risks are bounded by the worst possible thing that can happen.

The worst possible thing that can happen, is the following:

1. All the fish and whales in the ocean die
2. All the wild animals on land die
3. All the humans die

There are many other predictions that might come true, but that is the gist of it.
While there are greater systemic risks that is part of foundation of life,
these 3 risks are easy to understand, which in turn makes them easy to reason about.

### I don't care about whales dying, why is that part of the worst possible thing that can happen?

The whales do not care about you dying either.

The point is to try reach beyond your Ego and think about "the worst possible thing that can happen"
as an outside-the-box thing, which is not directly relevant for your life.
Anything that makes whales die is likely to also influence your own life,
but it takes a lot of inference steps to figure out why.
Instead of starting with "me" as the single entity of concern,
it is better for reasoning about Climate Action to expand the "virtual sensory apperatus" to more entities.
These entities are spread around the Earth and in different environments to cover the overall health of ecosystems.

### Who are the bad guys?

There are no "bad guys", there are only "bad languages".

Human brains can reason very abstractly about their environment and societies,
which allows us to perform complex tasks.
However, the downside of reasoning abstractly is complexity of language,
which forces us to take subjective perspectives in order to for reasoning to be efficient.
Some of these subjective perspectives do not consider the well being of fish, whales, animals and humans.

Thus, it is the mechanism of subjective abstract reasoning that kills life.
The power of humans have to perform complex tasks also destroys the environments that support life.
