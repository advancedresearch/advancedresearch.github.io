# Climate Action

Climate Action is a form of [deliberate existence](https://advancedresearch.github.io/blog/2022-03-10-deliberate-existence) to address [Climate Change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change).

### Should I do something?

Before you decide anything, you should collect and organize information that might be helpful for you to make a decision.

Humans often have a big Ego, which is formed by genes and culture.
In reality, most of the stuff going on in the world is not about us, still our lives are influenced by it.
This means that in order to know whether one can do something useful or not,
one has to reach into the "unknown" that goes past direct relevance for your own life in the moment.
If you can extend yourself in this way and think about the world this way, then it is possible for you to reason about Climate Action.
Otherwise, your best course of action is to rely on the direct advice by climate scientists.

Climate Action is best considered as a kind of outside-the-box way of thinking,
because our biases are not usually the best tool to support action.

### What is the worst possible thing that can happen?

To reason about Climate Action, one must understand the risks.
The risks are bounded by the worst possible thing that can happen.

The worst possible thing that can happen, is the following:

1. All the fish and whales in the ocean die
2. All the wild animals on land die
3. All the humans die

There are many other predictions that might come true, but that is the gist of it.
While there are greater systemic risks that is part of foundation of life,
these 3 risks are easy to understand, which in turn makes them easy to reason about.

### I don't care about whales dying, why is that part of the worst possible thing that can happen?

The whales do not care about you dying either.

The point is to try reach beyond your Ego and think about "the worst possible thing that can happen"
as an outside-the-box thing, which is not directly relevant for your life.
Anything that makes whales die is likely to also influence your own life,
but it takes a lot of inference steps to figure out why.
Instead of starting with "me" as the single entity of concern,
it is better for reasoning about Climate Action to expand the "virtual sensory apperatus" to more entities.
These entities are spread around the Earth and in different environments to cover the overall health of ecosystems.

### Who are the bad guys?

There are no "bad guys", there are only "bad languages".

Human brains can reason very abstractly about their environment and societies,
which allows us to perform complex tasks.
However, the downside of reasoning abstractly is complexity of language,
which forces us to take subjective perspectives in order to for reasoning to be efficient.
Some of these subjective perspectives do not consider the well being of fish, whales, animals and humans.

Thus, it is the mechanism of subjective abstract reasoning that kills life.
The power of humans have to perform complex tasks also destroys the environments that support life.

### Does the CO2 levels in the athmosphere actually matter?

Imagine a hypothetical world where it was not the CO2 levels in the athmosphere that caused fish, whales, animals and humans to die.
Yet, in this hypothetical world, something else is causing death.

The CO2 levels is just one measurement out of many.
CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas, nor is the greenhouse effect the only destructive consequence of Climate Change.

Climate change deniers talk about Climate Change in a way where error of reasoning happens around causation of concrete measurements,
like CO2 levels. In this language, anything is used to justify passivity of Climate Action.
The conclusion is the same and predictable, regardless of whether there are other good reasons to commit to policies that aligns with Climate Action.

Climate change deniers have always and will always be wrong about the basic facts of climate science.
However, notice that the way they are wrong is because the lack of outside-the-box thinking around Climate Action.
The language of climate change denial is destructive, not necessarily because facts are wrong,
but because it forces a way of thinking that is "undeliberate".

### Why Earth gets destroyed

The Earth gets destroyed to increase the profit margins about 5-10% in short term,
at the cost of 50-100% profit margins in the long term.

With other words, the destruction is not due to rational decision making,
but due to greedy bias.

Greedy bias is not an emotion, but a sub-optimal way of solving problems by first taking drastic actions that
increases utility in the short term, but needs redoing or undoing in the long term to maximize utility.

In practice, there is no person on Earth that benefits from lack of Climate Action.

### The plan of governments is to make the worst possible thing that can happen, becoming a reality

When people reason about governments today, they tend to weight official intentionality above internal intentionality.
The reality is that the internal intentionality of governments is to continue activities and subsidies
that will make the worst possible thing that can happen, becoming a reality.

### Some changes seem drastic, but in practice they are OK

To become a vegan today, or eating less meat and consuming less diary products,
is seemingly drastic lifestyle change for somebody who does not like changes.

Furthermore, if policies were put in place to e.g. forbid over-consumption of meat,
then it would provoke emotions of having freedom restricted.

However, changing lifestyle is not the worst possible thing that can happen.
In practice these changes are OK.

### Inconvenience is not an argument against Climate Action

When your house gets flooded or you lose some in your family from the hundreds of consequences of Climate Change,
you will experience a situation that is much more inconvenient than "I feel uncomfortable thinking about it".

### What systemic changes are needed

In order to avoid the worst possible thing to happen, there are at least two things that are required:

1. Carbon capture must grow exponentially
2. Global anthropogenic emissions must decrease drastically

These two processes both need to happen in parallel.

It is not sufficient to decrease emissions drastically.
It is also not sufficient to grow carbon capture exponentially.

The number of inference steps requires to make these two processes happen,
is large, so it is a non-trivial task just to reason properly.

### Surviving doomsday-scenarios is not a good strategy

Surviving doomsday-scenarios is a common theme for Hollywood movies,
but is not a good strategy in reality.
The modern lifestyle of humans is so complex that it requires task specialization and vast logistics to work.
In practice, a such lifestyle can not be maintained indefinitely in any doomsday bunker.

The problem is not about survival in the short term.
The problem is how to make humanity successfully reproduce.

Without successful reproduction, humanity will die out.
Whether you can survive e.g. 20 years in a doomsday bunker is of little relevance,
except as a way to explore your Ego and testing out a Hollywood narrative in your life.
