Joker Calculus is the most reliable scientific way of inducing headache known to mankind.
It is a complete brain-fuck because it is a calculus that deals with existence (which is already a brain-fuck).

If you get enough practice, then you can keep the headaches beneath a tolerable level to develop a more flexible mind.
This calculus is an exercise for the brain.

Imagine a conversation between two people:

- Bob: "Yeah dude I'm just working out right now."
- Carl: "Oh yeah? what you on now?"
- Bob: "Just 12 sets of natural numbers"

Just like one can train the body using exercises that are repetitive and seemingly useless seen from the perspective of a single moment,
one can train the mind to become better using Joker Calculus in combination with ideas such as philosophy, art or mathematics.

Basically, it is like formalizing your imagination.

## Basic Exercises

These exercises are made to make people understand the basics of Joker Calculus.

### Level 1: Up and down

1. Imagine an up arrow.
2. Turn the arrow slowly down using an invisible hand in your imagination.
3. Release the arrow slightly before it is down.
4. Let the arrow snap into place as if attracted by a magnet.
5. Turn the arrow up again.
6. Repeat.

### Level 2: 0 and 1

Do the same exercise as level 1, but now there is a label on top, showing "0" and a label at the bottom showing "1".

### Level 3: The self-moving arrow.

1. Imagine an up arrow, pointing at label "0".
2. Imagine some force turning the arrow down, but it is not moved by your invisible hand.
3. When the arrow is down, this force is turned off.
5. Use your invisible hand to turn the arrow up again.
6. When the arrow is up, the force, turning the arrow down, turns on again.
7. Repeat.

### Level 3: The Joker

Do the same exercise as level 3, but now think about this as being called a "Joker".
The code for this joker is `?1`.

### Level 4: Flipping the Joker

Do the same exercise as level 3, but instead of a force driving the arrow down to "1", it activates at "1" and drives it up to "0".

1. Imagine a down arrow, pointing at label "1".
2. Imagine some force turning the arrow up, but it is not moved by your invisible hand.
3. When the arrow is up, this force is turned off.
5. Use your invisible hand to turn the arrow down again.
6. When the arrow is down, the force, turning the arrow up, turns on again.
7. Repeat.

### Level 5: Naming the flipped Joker

Do the same exercise as level 4, but now think about this as having the code `?0`.

### Level 6: Attracting the arrow - Part I

1. Imagine an up arrow, pointing at label "0".
2. Imagine holding an invisible magnet in your invisible hand.
3. When you move the magnet close to the arrow, it moves, pointing in that direction.
4. When you move the magnet away from the arrow, it goes back to "0".
6. Repeat.

### Level 7: Attracting the arrow from multiple directions - Part I

Do the same exercise as level 6, but try to vary the directions from where you move the magnet close to the arrow.
Repeat this excercise until you are comfortable approaching the arrow from any direction, including up and down.

### Level 8: Attracting the 0 arrow from 1 - Part I

Do the same exercise as level 6, but now do it only from the down direction labeled "1".

1. Imagine an up arrow, pointing at label "0".
2. Imagine holding an invisible magnet in your invisible hand.
3. When you move the magnet close to the arrow from below, it moves, pointing at label "1".
4. When you move the magnet down and away from the arrow, it goes back to "0".
6. Repeat.

### Level 9: Naming the distracted arrow - Part I

Do the same exercise as level 8, but now think about this as having the code "1 0".

### Level 10: Attracting the arrow - Part II

This exercise is the same as level 6, but for down instead of up.

1. Imagine a down arrow, pointing at label "1".
2. Imagine holding an invisible magnet in your invisible hand.
3. When you move the magnet close to the arrow, it moves, pointing in that direction.
4. When you move the magnet away from the arrow, it goes back to "1".
6. Repeat.

### Level 11: Attracting the arrow from multiple directions - Part II

Do the same exercise as level 10, but try to vary the directions from where you move the magnet close to the arrow.
Repeat this excercise until you are comfortable approaching the arrow from any direction, including up and down.

### Level 12: Attracting the 1 arrow from 0 - Part II

Do the same exercise as level 10, but now do it only from the up direction labeled "0".

1. Imagine a down arrow, pointing at label "1".
2. Imagine holding an invisible magnet in your invisible hand.
3. When you move the magnet close to the arrow from above, it moves, pointing at label "0".
4. When you move the magnet down and away from the arrow, it goes back to "1".
6. Repeat.

### Level 13: Naming the distracted arrow - Part II

Do the same exercise as level 12, but now think about this as having the code "0 1".

### Basic Exercises: Conclusion

Congratulations! You have now completed the training of basic exercises for Joker Calculus.

If you struggle with higher exercises, then take a break and start warming up with basic exercises.
Remember, the more work you put into the basic training,
the less energy you have to spend in the higher exercises.
Do not try to over-exercise your brain.

## Abstract Exercises

These exercises take what you learned from basic training and applying them abstractly.

### Level 1: Do not try to visualize the Joker - Part I

Think about the following codes in sequence, pausing 5 seconds between on each:

1. `0`
2. `1`
3. `?0`

When you come to the third step, you brain will attempt to visualize the Joker `0` with the code `?0`.
Do not let your brain visualize, but just rest your eyes on the expression of the third step.

Repeat.

### Level 2: Do not try to visualize the Joker - Part II

This exercise is the same as level 1, but with `?1` instead of `?0`.

Think about the following codes in sequence, pausing 5 seconds between on each:

1. `1`
2. `0`
3. `?1`

When you come to the third step, you brain will attempt to visualize the Joker `1` with the code `?1`.
Do not let your brain visualize, but just rest your eyes on the expression of the third step.
