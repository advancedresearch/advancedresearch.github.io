Joker Calculus is the most reliable scientific way of inducing headache known to mankind.
It is a complete brain-fuck because it is a calculus that deals with existence (which is already a brain-fuck).

If you get enough practice, then you can keep the headaches beneath a tolerable level to develop a more flexible mind.
This calculus is an exercise for the brain.

Imagine a conversation between two people:

- Bob: "Yeah dude I'm just working out right now."
- Carl: "Oh yeah? what you on now?"
- Bob: "Just 12 sets of natural numbers"

Just like one can train the body using exercises that are repetitive and seemingly useless seen from the perspective of a single moment,
one can train the mind to become better using Joker Calculus in combination with ideas such as philosophy, art or mathematics.
