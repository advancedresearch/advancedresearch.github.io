Joker Calculus is the most reliable scientific way of inducing headache known to mankind.
It is a complete brain-fuck because it is a calculus that deals with existence (which is already a brain-fuck).

If you get enough practice, then you can keep the headaches beneath a tolerable level to develop a more flexible mind.
This calculus is an exercise for the brain.

Imagine a conversation between two people:

- Bob: "Yeah dude I'm just working out right now."
- Carl: "Oh yeah? what you on now?"
- Bob: "Just 12 sets of natural numbers"

Just like one can train the body using exercises that are repetitive and seemingly useless seen from the perspective of a single moment,
one can train the mind to become better using Joker Calculus in combination with ideas such as philosophy, art or mathematics.

Basically, it is like formalizing your imagination.

### Level 1: Up and down

1. Imagine an up arrow.
2. Turn the arrow slowly down using an invisible hand in your imagination.
3. Release the arrow slightly before it is down.
4. Let the arrow snap into place as if attracted by a magnet.
5. Turn the arrow up again.
6. Repeat.

### Level 2: 0 and 1

Do the same exercise as level 1, but now there is a label on top, showing "0" and a label at the bottom showing "1".
