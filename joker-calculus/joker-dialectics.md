# Joker Dialectics

[Back to summary page about Joker Calculus](./summary.md)

Joker Dialects extends Joker Calculus with new operators, used to trace philosophical stances and dynamics:

- combination `+`
- equality `==`
- inequality `!=`
- movement `->`
- recursion `^n`

Based on notation used in the paper [Dialectical Masks: Hegel's Philosophy through the Lens of Joker Calculus](https://github.com/advancedresearch/path_semantics/blob/master/papers-wip2/dialectical-masks.pdf).
