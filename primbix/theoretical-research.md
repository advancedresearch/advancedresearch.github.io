# Primbix: Theoretical Research

Back to [Primbix Research](./primbix-research.md)

The current state of Primbix Research is primarily focused on the minimum primbix sequence.

One can think about Primbix Research as a meta-game, where the goal is to improve generated mathematical knowledge over time.

The minimum primbix is perhaps the most important sequence in Primbix Research.
This is because without any clear specific set of axioms about primbixes,
new mathematical knowledge generated depends on previously generated knowledge.

Over time, our goal is to generate enough mathematical knowledge to predict patterns in future generated knowledge.

The reason we want to predict patterns in future generated knowledge,
is because it makes decisions easier, such as:

- How much resources to spend on Primbix Research
- Evaluate whether we are satisfied with the current progress
- Whether Primbix Research should diversify investment of resources

Primbix Research has potential to become the longest running meta-game in all of history.
Currently, Prime Research is the longest running meta-game, with a history of over 2 thousand years,
but after the invention of computers, the interest in Prime Research has fallen gradually over time.

Primbix Research is designed to build on Prime Research, but to cause a sense of wonder for people living in a post-computer world,
in a similar way to how ancient people perceived Prime Research and made them more interested in mathematics.

This means, despite that computers are an important part of Primbix Research,
the creativity and ingenuity of people is predicted to remain an important ingredient in future generated mathematical knowledge.

Millions or years from now, people might still work on Primbix Research, thousands times longer than Prime Research has kept people interested.

We are now in the very early phase of Primbix Research, where we focus on the most important building blocks for the future meta-game.

While Primbix Research in general might be thought of like a board game,
the pieces that people play with in this meta-game,
are constructed out of generated mathematical knowledgea about minimum primbixes.
This is why the minimum primbix sequence is so important.

The rules of the meta-game are arbitrary.
However, the pieces that people play with, are mathematical determined.
This design is because it is fun to make up your own rules,
while sharing a common set of signs with their own particular research history and cultural context.

Over time, as more and more building blocks are finished for the meta-game,
the achievement of finding new building blocks will increase.
After millions of years, a new building block will be a cause of popular celebration.
It will be a measure of how far civilization has progressed.

Primbix Research is designed to never be completed, like mathematics in general.
It is predictated that it will always be possible to make progress, within the expected lifetime of the universe.
This progress is predicated on people passing down knowledge about Primbix Research to future generations.

### Why finding new terms in the minimum primbix sequence will be super-exponential hard over time

The primbix formula is primes of the form `1 + 2 * r * s`, where `r, s` are primes.

The mathematical structure between a minimum primbix and the next one is not completely understood.

However, so far, the gap between minimum primbixes increases faster than the gap between `2^n` and `2^(n+1)`.

The explanation is that the primbix value is `0` for composite numbers, `1` for primes and `primbix(r) + primbix(s)` for primes of the form `1 + 2 * r * s`.
This counts the number of leaves in the associated binary tree.

The `2` factor in the primbix formula `1 + 2 * r * s` means that,
if you have two primbixes `r, s` with values `primbix(r)` and `primbix(s)`,
the composed primbix is at least twice of the product `r * s`.

Now, this does not prove that there is a super-exponential gap between minimum primbixes in general.
The actual argument is based on the smallest possible gap, relative to some minimum primbix:

Let's say we have a minimum primbix `r` with value `primbix(r)`.
The smallest gap possible relative to `r`, is when `s = 2`, the lowest primbix of value 1.
The composed primbix will be `1 + 2 * r * 2` with value `primbix(r) + 1`.

This argument falls short in two ways:

1. Minimum primbixes are not in general based on the previous minimum primbix
2. Hypothetically, if minimum primbixes were based on the previous minimum primbix, then the gap should be at least 4 times larger.

In one sense, these two ways this argument falls short, are perspectives on the gap, biased toward smaller and higher relative to each other.

So far, we are not 100% sure that the gap between minimum primibixes will be super-exponential,
but the terms that have been found, indicates that these gaps will continue increase super-exponentially.

Even if some gaps were sub-exponential, which meaning can be difficult on how low we set the exponential rate,
then the overall argument about super-exponential hardness still stands.

When we talk about super-exponential rate, the most common rate is `2^n`.
It is possible that the minimum primbix sequence follows some rate higher `k > 1`, where `k^n`,
and where the terms in the sequence alternates infinitely number of times over and under the curve of this rate.

In general, as a starting point to talk about super-exponential hardness over time,
we tend to use `2^n`, but upon closer and more detailed debate, it might shift over to some more technical meaning.

Technically, what super-exponential hardness means, is that as the minimum primbix goes to infinity,
it will go over any finite `k > 2` of `k^n`.
The reason we do not talk as much about super-exponential hardness in this sense,
is because it does not matter for practical Primbix Research in the foreseeable future.

We can distinguish these two meanings:

- Weak super-exponential hardness: Above `2^n`, observed after a few terms
- Strong super-exponential hardness: Above any finite `k > 2` of `k^n`, when the sequence goes to infinity

So, when we talk about practical potential counter-examples,
it is about whether `2^n` ever catches up, in future expected terms that we will find.

We are probably at least 99% confident that `2^n` will never catch up within the expected lifetime of the universe.

It also seems possible that the minimum primbix sequence has strong super-exponential hardness over time.
However, this case requires a much more elaborated argument, that is difficult construct properly.

Neither of the arguments we have made so far, are 100% convincing that the gaps are super-exponential, even in a weak sense.
Our belief that these gaps are super-exponential, is simply a summary of the knowledge and experience we have about Primbix Research.
Based on this knowledge and experience, we predict that the gaps will be super-exponential in the future.
