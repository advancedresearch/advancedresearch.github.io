# Why we need a Youth World Parliament
by Sven Nilsen, 2023

What can be more serious than a failing global elite in a time of crisis?

**Humans are causing large scale unintentional geo-engineering without governmental oversight.**

COP28 was hijacked by the oil industry, which most people keeping up with the news know by now.

However, there is a much more serious issue that needs to be addressed.

[James E. Hanson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hansen) published a paper on the role of reduced aeorosols in the paper
[Global Warming in the pipeline](https://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/Documents/PipelinePaper.2023.05.19.pdf).

Basically, this paper says there is reason to believe that human decision making has caused approximately 1 W/m^2 energy imbalance in recent years.

If this paper reflect reality, then it implies that humanity has moved on from an era where
policy making on global warming was acceptable based on years of delayed scientific data.

- It takes months for new scientific information to pass peer-review
- It takes years for new peer-reviewed information to be summarized in IPCC reports
- It takes months for policy makers to make drafts based on IPCC reports

The cost of delaying this information might be monumental for the entire world.

I, Sven Nilsen, declare on behalf of humanity, given the best to my own scientific literacy and continuous dialogue with scientists,
activists, engineers and affected people by climate change:

**We, the humanity, need policy making based on real-time scientific data.**

It is up to humanity how it wishes to respond, but I have a suggestion for how to make this possible.

I suggest that we create a Youth World Parliament with democratically elected leaders through the 3 billion people connected to the internet.

The Youth World Parliament will consist of young elected leaders,
due to the need for more rapidly adapting to new scientific information as it passes peer-review.

The Youth World Parliament will have executive powers in parallel to the current billionaire elite.
