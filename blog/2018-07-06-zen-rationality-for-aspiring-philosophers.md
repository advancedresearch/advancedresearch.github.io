# Zen Rationality for Aspiring Philosophers
by Sven Nilsen, 2018

Here is an argument for Zen Rationality (ZR) which people might find intuitive.
The idea is to create a bird-eye perspective that points to Zen Rationality,
so I have to exaggerate the positions a lot to drive the point home.

### Platonism and Pragmatism

In western philosophy there are two major pillars that are in constant opposition to each other:

- Platonism: All ideas exists and therefore meaning is pre-determined
- Pragmatism: Ideas have only meaning because they are invented for practical purposes

Pragmatism appeals to many people because one is allowed to use intuition:

*If something seems useful to believe, then you do not need to any other excuse for believing it than it's useful.*

People like to go with their intuition as long it works, and when it fails one can always come up with some new kind of intuition for understanding things.

However, if I claim to have a time machine to sell you, then if you are a hardcore-pragmaticist,
you might think as following:

1. I don't really believe you have a time machine.
2. However, a time machine would be very, very useful to have.
3. Therefore, I will check it out, just in case you got a time machine.

The overall problem with pragmatism is that if something seems very, very useful and practical,
then it is easy to bait people (they are vulnerable to wishful thinking bias).
Of course, you might believe that over time you learn to not fall for such tricks.

However, if I was very, very smart and had an infinite number of tricks up my sleeve,
I could exploit a pragmatist an *infinite* amount of times.
They might not fall for the same trick twice, not even for all tricks, but there will always be *some trick* they fall for.
No matter how clever you are, there is always a way to be tricked when your opponent is arbitrary intelligent,
as long you insist keeping the pragmatic position.

A hardcore-platonist will not fall for this trick:

1. I don't think the concept of a time machine can exist.
2. Therefore, I will not check it out.

Even if I was very, vary smart and had an infinite number of tricks up my sleeve,
I could only exploit a platonist a *finite* number of times.

Here is the reason:

- A platonist consider the possibility that the world of ideas exists independently of the real world
- Therefore, a platonist will be more willing to explore ideas and concepts that are not immediately practical or useful
- When building experience about the world of ideas, the platonist discovers there are *laws* to which ideas exists
- The laws of ideas in the platonic world makes it more likely to generalize to unknown and unseen situations

When you try to trick a platonist with a lie, you have to out-race his ability to think and reason.
There are vanishing return on investments on intelligence when the opponent believes `1+1=2`
despite all incentives to believe otherwise.
In the long run, a "medium" smart person catches up to see through the lies of a "highly" smart person
and will not be tempted no matter how useful and practical it might seem, as long it seems likely untrue.

Most people are not actually hardcore-pragmaticists or hardcore-platonists, even if they say they are.
They are often something in between, with a big dash of intuition and inconsistent views.

In the extreme case, pragmatism can be rejected by possible pragmatic reasons,
without a pragmatist having valid arguments to object.
This sounds ridiculous, because it is, when you think about it from a platonistic perspective.
A platonist would never reject pragmatism if he was a pragmaticist,
because it would not be philosophically consistent.

On the other hand, a hardcore-platonist would have problems with even simple tasks,
because if every idea already exists and all meaning is eternal and unchanged,
what is the motivation to do anything, at all?
A platonist is only able to survive because eating is what makes it possible to expore new ideas.

There is a philosophical position that is something between pragmatism and platonism:

### Instrumental Rationality

Assume you have a goal.

Now, you are allowed to form hypotheses about the world,
but only in a way that makes these hypotheses relevant for achieving the goal.

An instrumental rationalist will not fall for the time-machine trick:

1. I think it is highly unlikely that you have a time machine.
2. A time machine would be useful, but not enough useful given how unlikely it is.
2. Therefore, I will not check it out.

However, if you give an instrumental rationalist a stupid goal,
such as wanting there to be only 2 prime numbers,
the instrumental rationalist *gets stuck*,
because there exists infinite amount of prime numbers.
What can he do?

When you do not know what you want to do, there is no help in instrumental rationalism.

In a similar way, pragmatism empathize usefulness and practicality,
but is not usefulness relative to some goal? What if the goal is unknown? Does usefulness have any meaning?

A platonist might think "Just pick one goal that is possible to achieve! There are *rules* for that sort of thing!".
However, a platonist does not know which of two possible goals is the better one.

This is the argument for rejecting instrumental rationality.
Say hello to Zen Rationality!

### Zen Rationality

If you think of platonism and pragmatism as two opposite forces of a fierce debate,
it is easy to neglect the good things about the other side than the one you pick,
and ignore the bad things about the side that you are on.

Instead, why not consider platonism and pragmatism as tools for crafting out a better philosophical position?

This work of finding a better and stronger philosophical position might never be completed,
yet, it is possible to move on from instrumental rationality to better and deeper ideas.

First, a platonist might help the pragmatist to list all possible goals.
Second, the pragmatist orders the goals that seem useful and practical.

In order for a zen rationalist to be philosophically consistent,
the platonist would demand that if there exists a smarter version of the zen rationalist,
then what one knows about the smarter version should not be possible to exploit in advance, out-performing the zen rationalist.

A pragmatist might help the platonist to build a way for the zen rationalist to imagine smarter versions of itself.
It is not possible to simulate a more complex version in real-time,
so instead of running a full simulation, there must be some hypotheses of how a smart version would look like,
and algorithms that predict some aspects of its behavior, in a way that is useful and practical.

Zen Rationality is named so because of the inspiration from eastern philosophy,
where reasoning about goals has been more a central topic than in western philosophy.

Given the world we live in has constraints, there are some goals that are possible to achieve and some that are not.
Some goals are better to have than others because they work in harmony with our bodies and society.
There are rules for which goals are possible and why some goals are important while others are not.
Actions we make should be taken with the knowledge that our final goal might be unknown and discovered on the way.

In this way, Zen Rationality appears similar to instrumental rationality,
because instrumental goals tend to converge, but without a fixed goal in mind.
The uncertainty of the goal drives exploration of new ideas and concepts that might not seem useful or practical at first.
