# Platonism vs Seshatism - Part 1
by Sven Nilsen, 2021

*For background, read [Seshatism](https://github.com/advancedresearch/path_semantics/blob/master/papers-wip2/seshatism.pdf) in the sequence about [Avatar Extensions](https://github.com/advancedresearch/path_semantics/blob/master/sequences.md#avatar-extensions).*

In the divine realm, Plato meets Seshat to have a debate about ideas and existence.

Plato: Good evening Seshat!  
Seshat: Good morning Plato!

Plato: Why do you say “good morning”? It is evidently that the sun is going down.  
Seshat: It depends on how you view the world. In my frame of reference, the sun is going up!  
Plato: Is that a metaphore for the duality between Platonism and Seshatism?  
Seshat: Indeed.  
Plato: My guess is that you do not actually experience time backwards.  
So, you chose to say “good morning” instead of “good evening” as a way to talk about this duality.  
Is that not inconsistency?  
Seshat: You take yourself too seriously, my old friend.  

Plato: What do you do in your daily life? What is it like to be Seshat?  
Seshat: As part of my job of being a goddess, I nurture and grow all things.  
Plato: Have you ever pondered upon the deepest questions of life? Why do things exist?  
Seshat: It seems you have. Now, tell me. Why do things exist?  
Plato: I have not figured it out yet. Existence seems to be a deep mystery to me.  
Seshat: In what sense?  
Plato: I wake up every morning, going about my routines.  
A philosopher like me got a lot to do, teaching students and so on.  
Despite my profession is it hard to find time to develop my ideas further.  
I draw some comfort from the idea that whatever I do,  
it has already existed as a possibility and I am merely executing that possibility as an actuality.  
Seshat: What is the mystery in that?  
Plato: I view the world in terms of facts and numbers.  
Everything ought to be describable and measurable.  
Yet I can not fully describe my own experience on a daily basis.  
It is not that I want to, but I see the possibility that I can not describe every part of my experience, in principle.  
Seshat: Does it bother you?  
Plato: I want to come to terms with my own form of existence. I want to know.  

Seshat: To know is to desire.  
Plato: How so?  
Seshat: We choose to remember and we choose to forget.  
Plato: Do you mean what we use knowledge for, controls what we consider knowledge?  
Seshat: Sleep, child. Hush. These are things you will understand better when you get older.  
Plato: I want to know!  

Plato: How can we ever come to agreement when every argument I put forward,  
you have one in return due to the duality between Seshatism and Platonism?  
Seshat: You are right! You are wrong. Problem solved.  

Seshat: Good night Plato!  
Plato: Good day Seshat!
