# The Hobbyist Survivors and The Magical Factory
by Sven Nilsen, 2020

3 years ago, I wrote a fictional short story about a meeting between a journalist and the first "Zen Robot".
You can read the short story [here](https://github.com/advancedresearch/advancedresearch.github.io/blob/master/blog/2017-12-12-conversation-with-the-first-zen-robot-in-2050.md).

The reason I wrote this story, was to explore the difference between higher order rationality and common human reasoning.
In the story, the robot warned the journalist about climate change multiple times,
and predicted that humans would not actually do anything about it, only convince themselves they were already doing the right thing.

3 years later, what is the status of climate change?

Basically, the annoying Zen Robot was right!

The phrase "climate change" is not one that I prefer to use. Therefore, in this article I will use "global warming" instead.

This article is about exploring the problem of global warming from another viewpoint, plus an idea called the "The Magical Factory".

### Awareness does not imply action

A lot of people have become aware of global warming, yet they have not actually started doing anything about it.
I mean, except from some minor, statistically insignificant, changes to behavior.
Will driving an electric car, recycle more garbage, put up some wind mills and solar panels, or making empty political promises help? Of course not!

Why is it that people can be aware of some urgent, life-threatening problem, and not coordinate to handle the situation?

The reason is that humanity created a self-enforcing mental image of the situation: Survival is only a hobby.

### Save the world in your spare time

Once upon a time, there was an extremely dangerous chemical process happening on a planet filled with intelligent life.
A side-effect from extracting hydrogen atoms from the planet's crust, produced molecules which warmed the planet as a blanket.

The radiation from the local star, instead of bouncing off the planet,
hit the molecules on their way back to space and bounced back toward the surface.
The kinetic energy from this radiation increased the overall kinetic energy in the gases and solids.

As a result, all the natural mechanisms which kept the biosphere alive, collapsed.

Luckily, this intelligent species allocated resources to save their world.

The resources? A bit of voluntary work from a few aging and underfunded scientists.

The rest of the planet (billions) just kept doing what they were doing: Extracting hydrogen atoms from the planet's crust.

Who needs to survive? Survival is something you do in your spare time, for enjoyment!

### Keynesian economics

You would expect that the companies who made most money and emitted most of the pollution,
would feel the social responsitility of redesigning their oil refineries to use multiple sources of hydrogen.

After all, would not these companies be interested in their own survival? Apparently not!

Why not? Because research was thought of as part the government's responsibility.

Many people believe they live inside a "capitalist" system,
when they actually live inside a system that tries to prevent actual capitalism from happening.

It happens like this:

- The tax payers pay for research
- The private industry profits from research
- The patent system protects the rights of the private industry from competition

Basically, the oil industry want other people to pay the price, while keeping all the profits.
You do the work, we sit back and and do nothing! Sounds familiar?

It works brilliantly! Never have so many people been surviving as a hobby.
These companies managed to squeeze R&D below 1% of their yearly revenues.

However, there is a major problem: It is very hard to do redesigning of *oil refineries* at a university!

Ops. How can they solve this without hiring any... gasp! ... *innovative people*??!!!

### How to make science focus on "the right things"

In any science documentary about global warming, you see some exotic scenery of people traveling to places like Antarctica.
Or the Greenland ice sheet, or glaciers.

Why bother making science documentaries of the places where the pollution happens?

It is much better to make documentaries about places where normal people can not go or do anything about it.

After all, survival is only a hobby.

### The Magical Factory

Here are some of assumptions, which I am using:

- Using human labour to solve this is insufficient (It is only 1/200 of the world economy, the other 199 parts are machines)
- The energy sources humans use are insufficient, because they rely mostly on combustion
- The infrastructure on land is insufficient, which requires combustion to build

Obviously, you have to build a machine, of some kind.

A human baby starts as a single cell, and nine month later it is a baby consisting of a couple trillions of cells.
When you want to scale up something quick, you might wisely take inspiration from nature.

Imagine a factory, which floats in the ocean:

1. The factory is capable of producing a copy of itself
2. The factory is capable of using local energy sources

Since the copy of the factor is also capable of using local energy sources,
it too can create a copy of itself, and so on.

You scale this up until you reach the scale where these factories suck up greenhouse gases from the atmosphere,
at a rate that balances the industry pollution.

How is this possible?

- Seawater contains magnesium.
- Magnesium can be burned in dry ice (frozen CO2) to produce graphene.
- Graphene can be 3D printed to produce a material 10x stronger than steel and 10x lighter.

The 3D printed material can be used to produce a copy of the factory.

As you might have guessed, this idea was developed just for fun, as a hobby.

Why would anyone come up with such an idea otherwise? Survival is just a hobby!

### Hobbyist survivors teams up to save the world

So, humanity, the ultimate hobbyist survivors, team up to build The Magical Factory.

They use some spare money saved up during the years from *Occational Thinking About Stuff* and *Worrying About It*.

However, this was not lazy enough!

They decided that they only needed enough time to build *one prototype*.

Since, they figured out that, if the prototype works, then the world is saved.

Who cares about time? Who cares about testing? Who cares about being careful?

Survival is just a hobby!

### Reality

People are working on alternatives to The Magical Factory, which all have something common: Insufficient solutions.

The harsh reality is expected to be something like this:

1. There is not enough time to act, unless we invent Artificial General Intelligence to assist us.
2. The Magical Factory will never be built due to not inventing the Artifical General Intelligence in time.
3. Since 1) and 2), there is only one conclusion: Humanity goes functionally extinct.

Why? Because "hobbyist survivor" is an oxymoron.
You can't treat an emergency as a hobby problem and expect to survive.
