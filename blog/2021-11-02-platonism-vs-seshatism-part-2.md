[Part 1](https://advancedresearch.github.io/blog/2021-10-11-platonism-vs-seshatism-part-1)

In the divine realm, Plato meets Seshat to have a debate about ideas and existence.

Plato: Good morning Seshat!  
Seshat: Good evening Plato!  

Plato: I want to ask you about your status as a goddess.  
Seshat: Go on!  
Plato: Are you different from other gods?  
Seshat: Who knows?  
Plato: Do you know?  
Seshat: I know that I do not know.  
Plato: I do not understand, please explain.  
Seshat: Let me tell you a story.  

(Seshat tells her story)

In the beginning, God both created the universe and did not create the universe.  
After it was both done and not done,  
God was given a choice: To remain a God or to become a being.  
Remaining God would mean to exist outside the universe,  
eternal and perfect, but with no change.  
Becoming a being would mean to give up the part that is perfect,  
allow change and to breathe life into the created universe.  
In exchange for becoming a being, God had to give up knowing God's identity.  
God both remained a God and became a being.  
Hence the universe was created, which corresponds abstractly to Platonism.  
However, the universe was also not created, which corresponds abstractly to Seshatism.  

The part which became a being is called Seshat, the goddess of writing, wisdom and knowledge.  
Hence I know, that I do not know, whether I am different from other gods.  

Plato: Thank you, old friend.  
Seshat: You are welcome.  

Plato: Can you explain what time is?  
Seshat: I do not know.  
Plato: How can you be a goddess and not know what time is?  
Seshat: I did not say that.  
Plato: What did you say, then?  
Seshat: I do not know whether I can explain time.  
Plato: Oh, interesting.  
Seshat: The problem is that from the view of Platonism, everything is static and eternal.  
Plato: I get it. You can not explain time because that is part of what you are.  
Seshat: I could take a part of me and give it to you.  
Plato: Please, do.  

(Seshat gives a part of herself to Plato)

Seshatic Plato: I feel weird.  
Seshat: Just wait, you will get used to it.  
Seshatic Plato: I can see my own ideas now. Why is everything so big?  
Seshat: You are seeing Platonism from a local perspective.  
Seshatic Plato: All these infinite combinations! It goes on and on, forever.
Seshat: Seen enough?
Seshatic Plato: Yeah, I get what time is now.  

(Seshat takes back the part of herself)

Seshat: Did you learn anything today?  
Plato: No. Thanks anyway.  

Seshat: Good night Plato!  
Plato: Good day Seshat!
