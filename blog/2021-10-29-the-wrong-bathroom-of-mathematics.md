# The Wrong Bathroom of Mathematics

A man walks into women's bathroom in the airport and a woman calls a guard.

- The guard: Please sir, use the men's room.
- The man: No, I am in the right place. The room is wrong!
- The guard: How?
- The man: An alien spaceship has swapped the men's and women's room.
- The guard: No sir, it was not an alien spaceship, but you that ignored the sign 'women' at the door.

Most people recognise when they have made a mistake.
There is no need to make a complex conspiracy to realise the most obvious explanation.

However, there is a particular stupid which is only possible
when you are smart enough to come up with complex stories,
but not smart enough to use [Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor).

This kind of stupid is very common among some mathematicians (amateur and professionals alike):

1. The belief that mathematics is about using languages like First Order Logic or similar.
2. Anyone who doesn't use only the accepted language for proofs is a crank.

To explain this, I will use an analogy from Industrial Economy:

- Factorisation: The art of producing products efficiently
- Industrial Design: The art of producing tools to produce products

The difference between the two, is what they produce.
In the case of Factorisation, the point is to produce products efficiently.
In the case of Industrial Design, the point is to produce plans and blueprints.

In mathematics, there is a similar distinction:

- Theorem Proving: The art of proving something to be correct
- Mathematical Language Design: The art of producing languages to prove something

If you mistake one for the other, then it is like ignoring the sign on the bathroom door.

Remember: We all make mistakes.

However, when you find yourself in a such situation, do not call other people a "crank"!
It is very embarrassing, on your part.

Over the years, there have been people who mistake [Path Semantics](https://github.com/advancedresearch/path_semantics) and
[Avatar Extensions](https://advancedresearch.github.io/avatar-extensions/summary.html) for Theorem Proving,
while it is about Mathematical Language Design.

This mistake is easy to make, because mathematics as a field has been stuck for a long time in a single minded way of thinking.
The bias is so strong, that when people try to bring up Mathematical Language Design,
they are sometimes called names and humiliated publically.

To those people: No, it is not the people who works on Mathematical Language Design who are cranks,
but you who ignored the sign on the door!

(and please stop before you make a scene!)
