*In an episode of Star Trek Voyager, Tom Paris breaks the warp speed limit and told his experience as "existing everywhere and any time in the universe at once".
The idea of objectivity as "uniform subjectivity" is kind of the same, not absence of subjectivity, but an unbiased representation of it.
This is him, right before he de-evolves into a prehistoric creature, altering his DNA as a side effect of traveling this fast.*

In this blog post I will discuss the philosophy of absolute objectivity and problems it introduces in mathematics.
I also introduce "uniform subjectivity" to talk about objectivity in a different sense than opposition to subjectivity.

This idea is based on my experience with working on [Avatar Extensions](https://advancedresearch.github.io/avatar-extensions/summary),
which has a gradually changed how I think about objectivity vs subjectivity in mathematics.

### Objectivity as opposite to individual subjectivity

From the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)) article on objectivity:

> In philosophy, objectivity is the concept of truth independent from individual subjectivity (bias caused by one's perception, emotions, or imagination)."

From the article on objectivity in the [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/objectiv/):

> The terms “objectivity” and “subjectivity,” in their modern usage, generally relate to a perceiving subject (normally a person) and a perceived or unperceived object. The object is something that presumably exists independent of the subject’s perception of it. In other words, the object would be there, as it is, even if no subject perceived it. Hence, objectivity is typically associated with ideas such as reality, truth and reliability.

With other words, objectivity is often defined as an opposite, or independence, to *individual subjectivity*.

There are many uses of the words "subjective" and "objective", but I will not go into all of them here.
The use of "subjective" and "objective" I refer to is more to question the contextual framework we use to think about these terms.

In particular, I oppose the position of defining "objective" in terms of the opposite, or independence, of "subjective".
I find this approach very problematic, because it uses specific human capabilities, or functions like a complementary set.
It is not very informative of what we actually mean by something being objective.

To explain what I find lacking in this approach, one can think about the definition of prime numbers:
A prime number can be defined as not being a composition number, but when the definition of a composition number is missing,
I would be unsatisfied with a such definition. Instead, a prime number is often defined as the lack of certain mathematical properties,
in terms of concrete operations such as divisibility. I find more satisfying the latter approach of defining prime numbers.

The key insight is that a definition should guide the intuition toward concrete examples of the existence of certain mathematical properties,
or the lack of thereof.

I believe an ideal definition of objectivity should be without reference to things that are specific to being a human.
Fortunately, one does not need to look very far: The word "bias" is already mentioned in the Wikipedia article.

One might use *bias* to generalize this approach of defining objectivity.

### Objectivity as opposite to bias

Bias can be studied outside the framework of human physiology.

Algorithms can have bias, e.g. a biased 3D renderer, which means it does not converge to the [rendering equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_equation).

Thererfore, a computer scientist might find a definition of objectivity, as opposite to bias in general, more satisfying.

However, I think this definition too is problematic.

It is very hard to come up with a general definition of bias that is not involving some kind human-centric point of view.

From the [Wikipedia]() article on bias:

"Bias is a disproportionate weight in favor of or against an idea or thing, usually in a way that is closed-minded, prejudicial, or unfair."

I would definitively label this definition of bias as human-centric.

This definition of bias seems to sound more biased than what I actually mean when I use the word "bias".

OK, maybe I can try to use bias in the sense of algorithms.
However, instead of working around problems that are specific to the definition of bias, I want to go back to the definition of objectivity.
I believe this a problem that will occur in many different approaches and I would rather have a method that works for all of them.

Is it possible to elaborate on a definition of objectivity that is free of any human-centric point of view?

### Absolute objectivity

The intuition that people have about something being objectively true, is what they mean when they refer to it as a "fact".

A fact is something that just is, independent of whether one believes it or not.

Notice that, again, I have failed to eliminate the human-centric point of view, since I included the word "believe".

However, imagine that I had a magical machine with these properties:

1. I can program the machine with any problem and any goal
2. The program will produce an answer immediately with a solution, if it exists

I program the machine with the goal "find a non-human-centric definition of objectivity, starting with objectivity being opposite of subjectivity".

Now, consider the possibility that this machine outputted a solution.

By reading this new definition created by the machine, I might get an understanding of what *absolute objectivity* is.

The way I imagined how it would feel like to experience absolute objectivity, was as if I were floating in an empty universe,
existing everywhere, yet not being aware of anything in that universe, because being aware means I am processing information from a subjective point of view.

This might seem like a contradiction: How can one exist everywhere, yet not experience anything?

As an example, one could point to a chair, say the chair exists, yet it does not experience anything.
Hence, the chair is referred to as an object, and this idea generalized is what we think of as "objective".

Now, consider the possibility that the machine answers "There exists no solution".

### The possibility of absolute objectivity as an impossibility

Since I do not have access to a definition of objectivity that excludes all forms of human-centric point of views,
I might consider the consequences of the possibility that a such definition is impossible.

What kind of consequences would this bring e.g. to mathematics?

For example, when I write a computer program that operates on natural numbers,
I have a feeling that the program is "objective" in some sense, although I can not explain precisely what I mean by that.

There are two philosophical positions that I can imagine would be relevant in a such situation:

1. I assume that absolute objectivity exists, although I am unable to find a definition for it
2. I assume that absolute objectivity is impossible

The second position is quite interesting.

### When some degree of subjectivity is always necessary

The idea that mathematics might not be free of subjectivity, is thought provoking.

It is also interesting to see whether one can refine the language we use in philosophy,
to more accurately address the ideas around subjectivity and what it means.

For example, to develop a theory of consciousness, I could start with a notion of human-level subjectivity.
As I reduce the consciousness into processes happening in the brain, I simultaneously reduce the notion of subjectivity to other forms.
When I get down to the particle level of physics, I would start to understand something about how subjectivity is related to particles.

It is already common in physics to describe the world seen from a subjective perspective: Coordinate systems.

### Coordinate systems and subjectivity

A coordinate system is a way to representing the states of a geometric system relative to a frame of reference.

Mathematically, it means that certain physical states have some nice mathematical properties.

For example, if I stand at the North Pole with a map that uses the North Pole as origo,
my own position would be `(0, 0, 0)`, the same as the North Pole.

The coordinate `(0, 0, 0)` is related to the subjective experience I have by standing at the North Pole,
but it is less subjective when you think about it as just a point in a coordinate system.

Still, the idea that one can think about certain coordinates as more subjective than others,
means that when I choose to represent a physical system with a coordinate system,
I am also choosing some degree of subjectivity that follows with the choice of the coordinate system.

From an algorithmic perspective, some descriptions of the world state require less information than other world states.

At meta-level, I could invent a rule "The position of the observer is at origo".

In principle, I could choose any point as `(0, 0, 0)`, hence creating an observer at any point.

This means, that every point has the same amount of potential subjectivity.

I can use this idea to come up with a weaker notion of objectivity.

### Objectivity as uniform subjectivity

In a system where I can not get rid of subjectivity,
I might define objectivity as following:

```
Objectivity as uniform subjectivity, means that the potential of subjectivity is the same everywhere
```

With other words, I no longer define objectivity as the opposite of subjectivity,
but as a *balanced subjectivity*.

Absolute objectivity might be thought of as a special case where the potential for subjectivity is zero everywhere.

For example, in the presence of human subjectivity, I can talk about objectivity in the sense of having potential being experienced by any human.

- "The sky is blue", something that feels like a "fact", but is subjective to human experience, our sensory perceptions and language faculties of the brain
- "For every day, there is a tomorrow", something that feels like a "fact", but is subjective to human semantics of time, missing some edge cases

Notice that I do not exclude any form of subjectivity to claim I am talking about something objectively.
Objectivity no longer means the opposite of subjectivity or the absence of it.

When we are talking about objects, as existing in themselves, independent of subjective experience,
I feel it is more precise to approach it as a counter-factual to something we start to think about from a subjective point of view.

I do not claim that objective existence is impossible, only that the definition of it as an opposition to subjectivity is problematic.
When broadening the definition of what objectivity can mean, one can also find that it supports circumstances that includes subjectivity.

### Uniform subjectivity and Avatar Extensions

When working on [Avatar Extensions](https://advancedresearch.github.io/avatar-extensions/summary),
I get a feeling of the mathematics, that I am thinking about some kind of uniform subjectivity.

It means, I no longer feel comfortable with thinking about objectivity as an opposition to subjectivity.

What this means for generalizing mathematics, I imagine as the following example:
One might introduce arbitrary amounts of subjectivity, yet keep the mathematics from being unsound, by making the subjectivity uniform.

With other words, it might be possible to make mathematics arbitrary subjective, without losing the weaker notion of objectivity.

This idea of looking at objectivity through a new lens of uniform subjectivity, feels like a conceptual breakthrough for me in the philosophy of mathematics.
