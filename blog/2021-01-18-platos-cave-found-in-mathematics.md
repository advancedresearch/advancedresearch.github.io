# Plato's Cave Found in Mathematics
by Tupshin Harper, Adam Nemecek, Sven Nilsen

(WIP)

In this blog post, we will summarize a result of discussions in [Philosophy of Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics) the past few months.

The basic result is that mathematics contains a fundamental illusion, like shadows on the walls of Plato's cave.
This illusion exists at the deepest level of mathematics and can not be avoided.
This has many implications in philosophy, for example in the philosophy of the mind.

### Inside vs Outside Theories of Mathematics

TODO

#### Definition of The Inside

An Inside Theory is a mathematical language which models external objects as unknowns.

#### Definition of The Outside

An Outside Theory is a mathematical language with at least one symbol which does not refer to its theory.

#### Properties of Inside Theories

TODO

An Inside Theory is like a puzzle game where you have all the pieces.
The only work that remains is to figure out how to put the pieces together.

#### Properites of Outside Theories

TODO

An Outside Theory is like a puzzle game where new pieces can be created.
Not only figure out how to put the pieces together,
but also what kind of puzzle game one would like to play
given the partial solution found so far.
