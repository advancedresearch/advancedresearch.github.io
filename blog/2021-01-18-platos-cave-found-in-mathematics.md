# Plato's Cave Found in Mathematics
by Tupshin Harper, Adam Nemecek, Sven Nilsen

(WIP)

In this blog post, we will summarize a result of discussions in [Philosophy of Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics) the past few months.

The basic result is that mathematics contains a fundamental illusion, like shadows on the walls of Plato's cave.
This illusion exists at the deepest level of mathematics and can not be avoided.
This has many implications in philosophy, for example in the philosophy of the mind.

### Introduction to Plato's Cave

TODO

### Inside vs Outside Theories of Mathematics

TODO

#### Definition of The Inside

An Inside Theory is a mathematical language which models external objects as unknowns.

#### Definition of The Outside

An Outside Theory is a mathematical language with at least one symbol which does not refer to its theory.

#### Properties of Inside Theories

TODO

An Inside Theory is like a puzzle game where you have all the pieces.
The only work that remains is to figure out how to put the pieces together.

#### Properites of Outside Theories

TODO

An Outside Theory is like a puzzle game where new pieces can be created.
Not only figure out how to put the pieces together,
but also what kind of puzzle game one would like to play
given the partial solution found so far.

### Position

The philosophical position argued for is that Outside Theories are the "true" theories of mathematics,
while Inside Theories are projections, or illusions, hence the allegory of Plato's cave.

### Argument

Imagine a puzzle game which can be solved upside down.
Swapping the image on the front does not change the puzzle.

A such image that can be swapped, exists in the core axiom of Path Semantics.
The order assumption (`F > X`) is introduced to eliminate a particular form of inconsistency.

[Avatar Extensions](https://advancedresearch.github.io/avatar-extensions/summary.html) implies that the order can be weakened in the language of graphs,
by constructing using [MoÌˆbius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip) topologies and remove diagonals using highest N-avatars.

This points toward the possibility that weaker notions of order is accessible in higher [homotopy levels](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/homotopy+level).
There might be a trade-off between the homotopy level complexity of the mathematical language used,
and the weakest possible notion of order.

Today, we understand the mathematics we know as a projection of a higher dimensional mathematics.
This projection is like a shadow, or illusion of knowing what mathematics is.

When the assumption of order is swapped uniformly, it is undetectable from within the mathematical theory.
This means that there exists some property that can not be modelled within mathematics,
without also embedding the entire mathematics into itself.

Therefore, Outside Theories is the only "true" theory of mathematics.
An Inside Theory is merely an illusion.
