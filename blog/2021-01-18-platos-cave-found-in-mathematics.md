# Plato's Cave Found in Mathematics
by Tupshin Harper, Adam Nemecek, Sven Nilsen

(WIP)

In this blog post, we will summarize a result of discussions in [Philosophy of Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics) the past few months.

The basic result is that mathematics contains a fundamental illusion, like shadows on the walls of Plato's cave.
This illusion exists at the deepest level of mathematics and can not be avoided.
This has many implications in philosophy, for example in the philosophy of the mind.

#### Definition of The Inside

An Inside Theory is a mathematical language which models external objects as unknowns.

#### Definition of The Outside

An Outside Theory is a mathematical language with at least one symbol which does not refer to its theory.
